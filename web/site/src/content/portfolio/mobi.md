My role at Mobi focused on growing, restructuring, and rebranding the club. To do this, I lead a data and peoples-first approach to understand organizational friction. I collaborated with multiple university organizations besides my own to foster a sense of community for computer science on campus. Most importantly, I was determined to champion inclusitivity and openness to computer science. I lead Mobi with passion, because I loved seeing people take off and have fun with programming.

## Accomplishments

I redesigned and developed multiple artifacts including flyers, posters, email, copy, t-shirt and website. I redeveloped the organization from the ground up. I restructured the way workshops and socials were run. I optimized each event to be more intentional with a hand on growth at each point. We grew our club from 4 members (which were officers only) Fall 2021 to over 100 members Spring 2022.

This peaked in a summer-long, multi-club collaboration called Project Temple (Octapoints) where I assisted leading 20 mentees to become security focused software engineers. I delivered biweekly workshops and I helped guide everyone in a simulated agile environment. Through this, the majority built a network of collaboration across 4 student organizations becoming officers at each. Most mentees have gotten an internship from the experience. Together, we revolutionized all of our clubs to work together, go to hackathons, form life-long friendships, and truly manifest a computer science community of fun and ambition.

## Challenges

Mobi was a student organization at the brink of destruction after the pandemic. There were many pain points that plagued the organization before and after the pandemic. x

One huge pain point was how I realized previous approaches were ineffective. Workshops were essentially secondary lectures that happened at the worst times: Fridays at 5:00 PM. Right when people were ready for the weekend and want to rest. Even before the pandemic, member participation would dwindle from 20-40 for the initial meetings to around 1-2 for the final.

Additionally, responsibilities gravitated towards the president which held organizational knowledge, but only for one person. When they graduated, the transition would not be clean and practiced for all officers. It also doesn't help that documentation was sporadic or non-existent.

Lastly, the club was male-dominated with huge variation in skills. Most members were beginners, but we were giving workshops on skills way beyond the typical member skill range. The culture felt very cold and intimidating for everyone. Even if the workshop was intended for folks to learn, they were afraid to ask questions.

We didn't know who we were building for, and what our specific focus was.

## Resolution

I put UX, communications, and marketing at the forefront of Mobi's revival. What is Mobi? What does Mobi do?

These were key questions that guided my choices for Mobi. I believed it to be a safe place for students to learn programming at any skill level. And more than that, I wanted Mobi to be fun. Coding is mathematical and logical by nature, but it's also very fun. I could see how much it scared people. I wanted to use my experience to give people the confidence to code and build their own apps with fun.

That's why restructuring Mobi overall was important. I lead with empathy first, understanding who Mobi's audience was. This involved talking to members throughout meetings and any promotional event. I spent a lot of time trying to understand where members were receptive, why they were at Mobi, and how we could get them to keep on coming to Mobi.

I realized that at the core, Mobi's old logo, represented by a hexagon, was actually everything was wrong with Mobi. It didn't feel inclusive or fun. Our posters felt lacking in friendliness.

So as a designer, I set out to redesign everything to communicate more clearly. Every point of communication will be geared towards including members and encouraging folks to come on by. This included elevator pitches, invitations, email campaigns, brochures, and flyers. They all have some way to join the club. I call it slippery slope UX. It's very low friction for anyone to join and feel included in the club.

Events and workshops will not be the speaker talking 80% of the time and way more interactive. Officers will go up to members and encourage them individually. People have more room to breathe and ask questions. I focus my attention on helping people _sitting in the back_ rather the front because I know that's where I would sit if I'm intimidated.

And even during officer meetings, they aren't random. They're structured with prioritized milestones, goals, and documentation. A lot of these changes weren't just by me but in collaboration with my team. I facilitated a culture of empathy and care, so everyone was involved at every inflection point.

## Learnings

I learned that leadership isn't hard because of having power; it's the responsibility of making choices to empower everyone. These choices can be super heavy and you'll forever be in the back seat pushing everyone forwards. It takes a lot out of a person, but seeing people succeed is worth it.
