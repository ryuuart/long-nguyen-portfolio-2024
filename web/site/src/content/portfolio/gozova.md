My role at Gozova, in a collaborative effort with the designer, involved developing, enhancing, and implementing some UI/UX solutions. I developed one React Native screen to track and rate delivery driver performance. I constructed an entire storage website to reduce burdens on the storage sales team. I enhanced the current website implementation to match more closely with Gozova's new brand. Next, I developed a blog website to increase our SEO ratings. I lastly designed and implemented a UX solution to enhance opportunities in the checkout experience. The main goal was to both provide the marketing team data and enable a safer checkout experience.
